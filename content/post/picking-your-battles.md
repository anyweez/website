I'm going to start this one off by saying that I generally prefer to avoid confrontation unless it's really important.

There are a lot of people who aren't good at handling disagreements; there are also some people who are remarkably good at it. In my opinion this is one of those dramatically undervalued skills that doesn't get the screen time that it deserves. I consider myself to be fairly good at it but I also find myself studying people who are much better at it, trying to pick up tools of the trade to get better. The best and most flexible tip I've come across thus far is simple to say, but much harder to practice: decide what you want the outcome to be before arguments starts. *Don't trust your frustrated brain to make the important decisions.* In many cases this will lead to avoiding senseless arguments altogether.

Let's start with a simple for-instance. If you've ever been in a relationship you've probably gotten into a least a minor scuffle with your significant other (if not, high five then think of disagreements between you and a sibling, parent, or other person that you've spent a decent amount of time with). Really small things can turn into surprisingly big issues in a heartbeat. If you feel this starting to happen, it's decision time. Wander aimlessly or let your ego take over and you're going to be making it harder than it has to be on both of you. Given that we want to be outcome-focused here, let's think through a couple of high-level categories:

 - **Getting someone to agree with you.**

 - **Getting someone to admit that you're right.** Sometimes the ego rears it's boastful head and just wants to hear that it knows what it's talking about. I find that this happens to me sometimes when discussing topics that I care a lot about; the most important element of this sort of debate is to be aware that it's this kind of debate. If you don't get what you yourself are shooting for (and whether it's actually worth shooting for), it's easy to push too far for superficial gains. I personally try to actively cut back on this type of conversation whenever I can.

 - **Having a debate.** Sometimes discussions (which I'd separate from disagreements, but it can sometimes be hard to tell) can be awesome and intentional. In this case the goal of the discussion is the discussion, so your work is already done once you start. Woohoo!

 - **Not having an argument.** The final bucket is when you find yourself amidst a disagreement and care more about the argument ending than any particular outcome. I find myself in this bucket a lot, and realizing that a particular outcome isn't the most important thing makes it much easier to compromise on things that may be more important to someone else than they are to you. The goal here isn't necessarily to end the discussion as quickly as possible as much as it is to realize that _winning this one isn't that important_.


 Always think about what you want to accomplish, if anything, from the conversation, and don't risk frustrating others by bouncing around between objectives a bunch. Despite the application to romantic relationships here, I've found that this works equally well in almost all of my relationships (friends, coworkers, family, and so on). You're basically focusing on what matters and swallowing your ego when it needs to be swallowed, which everyone can appreciate.

The first time I heard a variant of this tip was in a book many years ago and it sounded obvious when I read it. I've tried to follow it more explicitly over the past few years and I've been shocked by how much more directed and productive my social speed bumps have been. Give it a shot!
