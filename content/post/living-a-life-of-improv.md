I just finished my first post-middle school improv course from the fine folks at [Leela SF](http://www.leela-sf.com/) and was absolutely blown away by how much I took away from it. I joined the class thinking it'd potentially be fun and I'd perhaps get a bit more comfortable with myself but walked away with a bunch of new friends and a bunch of new perspectives on how I interact with others and myself. On day one our instructor told us that *improv was a lifestyle, not just a hobby.* It wasn't something you turned on and off. It was something that, if you let it, could shape the way you took on the world. I'm pretty sure I believed him, but I wasn't drinking the Koolaid. Now I'm chugging so much that I need to mix some more so that I have some to share. I'm convinced that it's a good (uncomfortable!) experience for everyone.

I'm still very much a beginner, but I've been looking back on the class and I found some of my takeaways interesting. Here's a list of some of the top things I realized, which basically boil down to *chill out and let it happen.*

### Koan 1: You are your biggest critic.

One of my most vivid realizations from the beginning of the course was how much we were concerned with being right, and how easy it was to let that go as the course progressed. During almost every exercise on the first day, we'd regularly ask for clarifications of the rules, making sure the exercise was well-defined and properly understood before being told that the rules we were looking for didn't exist. We were afraid of what would happen without the rules, and hesitant to proceed without them. Why? Because we might not be right. Turns out it can't turn out any other way if there are no rules.

Another really hard thing to shake is the sense of "messing something up." Maybe it takes you a while to come up with a line. Maybe you misunderstand what another person is saying and take the conversation in a totally different direction. Or maybe you do everything perfectly fine. It really doesn't matter. Stop beating yourself up about it. No one's judging you as much as you are.

### Koan 2: Listen. Understand before seeking to be understood.

You have to be aware of what's happening around you in order to respond to it. If you're having a conversation, don't pre-bake a response if it depends on what someone else is saying. Listen to what they say and respond to *them.* Hear them out. Your view of where the conversation should go is not necessarily the same as everyone else's.

There are some really great improv activities related to listening, most of which involve reacting to what the person before you said. For example, we did some collaborative storytelling activities that both point out how easy it is to get stuck in your own head and how valuable it can be to get out of it. There's a lot going on outside and you're missing all of it if you shut yourself off.

### Koan 3: Be aware of the limits you put on yourself.

Man, we sure do like to write rules for ourselves. Similar to #1 above, we seem to be creatures that like to create walls so that we can comfortably stroll around inside. That's all fine and dandy until you forget that there's something outside of those walls; improv really helped me remember the walls and start to move them around a bit. My two cents on this is that it's not a bad thing to have those limits, as long as you're aware that they're there because you put them there. You might be thinking that you could never do an improv class, for example. You put that there.

A ton of people in class, myself included, shared that one of the toughest activities for them was the exercised referred to as "the fool." The goal is to simply remove all constraints and do what the unfiltered version of yourself wants to do (barring violence and other physically harmful shenanigans). Scream profanity, roll around on the floor, flip over chairs, cry, laugh...whatever. I was stunned by how difficult this was to do, due in part to the deeply-embedded mental constraints I've put on myself not to act like that in public. I'm *glad* I've got those constraints in my everyday life but I was blown away by how strong my reservations were and how unaware I was of them.

### Koan 4: Go with your gut.

I'm not sure this is always good advice but I've found it valuable to be aware of what you say and, importantly, what you hold back. Perfectionism is often a curse and can hold back ideas that could blossom much more quickly if released half-baked. Get over the idea of always having to be right. Sometimes it's useful to wait for correctness and many other times it might actually be better just to put something out there. You'll probably be surprised with what others can do with it.

I personally have a habit of targeting perfection before putting something out in public, and it's something I'm actively trying to be better at. I've been resisting putting together this website for years because of the permenance of the internet, which to many would mean that you'd have to risk being wrong in the most public place the world's ever known. That sucks, but in my experience it's not nearly as bad as saying nothing at all. It's also an opportunity to learn new angles that you probably wouldn't have discovered on your own.

### Koan 5: The pit crew is as important as the driver.

Many people throughout the world are ambitious and want to be viewed at being good at what they do. Improv helped me realize how great it can be to be a support for the person in the spotlight versus being the star myself. Greatness doesn't come from an individual as much as it often seems like; it usually requires an alley oop from a teammate who set them up for success. Be okay with being the teammate.

A second important concept to roll under this one is improv's legendary ["yes and" rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Yes,_And%22_rule). The idea here is that you have to let go of the wheel sometimes and let someone else drive. If someone gives you a suggestion in improv, the cardinal sin is to reject that suggestion. Instead, you need to integrate it into the conversation and evolve along a new direction incorporating that input. That doesn't make it easier but it makes it far more interesting.

### Koan 6: Let it happen.

A lot of times we try to dodge everything we don't agree with coming our way and steer ourselves towards the things we do like. We're so obsessed with driving that we forget to look out the window. Turns out *there's a lot of stuff out there* and it's not something you would have created on your own. We are informed by our experiences and alternative opinions and if we're afraid to let go of the wheel we're going to miss the world around us.

Being in control is nice but you're just one person. Admit that the world is too big for you to control and become okay with participating.
