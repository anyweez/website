Call it madness but I really don't like the term "obviously," and I think the vast majority of uses of it make a lot of assumptions that in many cases may not be true (and alientate your audience!). When I was teaching, one of the things I learned was that you should avoid describing something as "simple," because if it's not easy for someone then knowing that they can't figure out something that's supposed to be simple [can be pretty dispiriting](http://qz.com/139453/theres-one-key-difference-between-kids-who-excel-at-math-and-those-who-dont/). Unless you're talking to a familiar audience it's also easy to lose touch with what's "obvious" for someone to know so it's easy to mislabel things to the unintended detriment of your listeners. Consider the following examples:

* _Emotional_: Don't be mad; I obviously didn't mean it.
* _Intellectual_: Obviously we'll be overestimating the effect of the medical treatment if we don't calibrate our instruments before measuring.
* _Organizational_: Obviously I'll ask my manager before leaving on vacation.

For some people, those things might be obvious. For others they might not be. Now let's try again, this time without making assumptions about what the listener knows:

* Don't be mad; I ~~obviously~~ didn't mean it.
* ~~Obviously~~ we'll be overestimating the effect of the medicine if we don't calibrate our instruments before measuring.
* ~~Obviously~~ I'll ask my manager before leaving on vacation.

As far as I can tell the sentences communicate exactly the same meaning and don't alienate. It feels the most relevant to me in intellectual examples.

Even if it was potentially alientating it might still be worth including given other benefits, but it's not clear to me what the conversational benefit of stating that something is "obvious" is. Those sentences read fine without (both for people who understand them and those who don't). Is it useful for helping people know not to overthink something? To puff up your own pride? To keep people from asking questions about it? My guess is that when you label something as being "obvious," you're often suppressing reasonable and important questions that should be asked by people who don't want to look dumb. If the goal is to get through something without ensuring understanding then perhaps that's where it becomes useful, but in mu experience
