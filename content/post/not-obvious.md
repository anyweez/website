Call it madness but I really don't like the term "obviously," and I think the vast majority of uses of it make a lot of assumptions that in many cases may not be true (and alientate your audience!). When I was teaching, one of the things I learned was that you should never describe something as "simple," because if it's not easy for someone then knowing that they can't figure out something that's supposed to be simple [can be pretty dispiriting](http://qz.com/139453/theres-one-key-difference-between-kids-who-excel-at-math-and-those-who-dont/). Unless you're talking to a familiar audience it's also easy to lose touch with what's "obvious" for someone to know. Consider the following examples:

* _Emotional_: Don't be mad; I obviously didn't mean it.
* _Intellectual_: Obviously we'll be overestimating the effect of the medicine if we don't calibrate our instruments before measuring.

For some people, those things might be obvious. For others they might not be. Now let's try again, this time without making assumptions about what the listener knows:

* Don't be mad; I ~~obviously~~ didn't mean it.
* ~~Obviously~~ we'll be overestimating the effect of the medicine if we don't calibrate our instruments before measuring.

It's not clear to me what the conversational benefit of stating that something is "obvious" is. Those sentences read fine without (both for people who understand them and those who don't) but are way more approachable without the extra label. Is it useful for helping people know not to overthink something? To puff up your own pride? To keep people from asking questions about it? My guess is that when you label something as being "obvious," you're often suppressing reasonable and important questions that should be asked by people who don't want to look dumb.
