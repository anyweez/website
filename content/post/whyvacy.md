The topic of the year in the tech community, possibly throughout the nation this year, is privacy. [Edward Snowden's revelations](http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files) have provided a stunningly detailed look into the underbelly of government surveillance across the world. The conversations are now in full swing about the implications and potential changes in policy that may be helpful in bringing the capabilities of the all-seeing eye into check with the expectations of the people they claim to support, while continuing to protect against violent attacks against American citizens at home.

There is a fundamental trade-off between privacy and security that exists regardless of what technology, laws, or other forces we have at our disposal. Security requires information, often some of which isn't publicly available orintended to be shared. At the same time, a democratic society cannot exist without the opportunity to debate controversial things publicly, and people are far less willing to discuss unpopular subjects if they know that their opinions could be turned against them.

A common argument that is common among the general public in the modern debate about privacy is that "if you haven't done anything wrong, you shouldn't have anything to worry about." Not only is this untrue from the perspective of personal safety, but it's especially misguided from a societal perspective.

### Why privacy actually matters
The first and fourth __ of the American Constitution outline two of the most foundational characteristics of a functional democracy. The most important, the first amendement, establishes the right of individuals to free speech, which encourages open debates and public accountability. The fourth amendmeent, one that I certainly underappreciated until giving it deeper thought, establishes the right of an individual to be safe from search from government agents except when there is suspicion of a crime. Search warrants were put in place to verify that appropriate suspicion was in fact present before police offers, for example, enterested someone's house unwelcomed. The fourth amendement directly addresses the conflict between security and privacy, and makes a clear statement that a degree of privacy is more important than full security. From both a legal and philosophical perspective, America's founding fathers recognized that maximizing security at the cost of privacy was not an appropriate target.

If public debate is at the heart of a democracy, and a democracy is our desired form of government, then we should make decisions that encourage public debate on contentious issues. One thing that both [research](TODO://HUMAN-BEHAVIOR-UNDER-SURVEILLANCE) and intuition suggest is that doing things like, oh I don't know, having the government read through and store all personal communications for everyone, for example, and be able to incriminate targets based on what they find. Minorities are much less likely to speak up if they think they might be punished for it. Unless you really, *really* care, why on earth would you?

These justifications depend on certain beliefs that I hold dear; if you disagree with these then your mileage may vary. Those beliefs are that (1) America and other economically stable countries should pursue some form of democracies in order to best advance the human condition, and (2) members of a democracy must be able to contest the beliefs of others and hold each other (personally and otherwise) accountable for their actions.  

#### Safe today, gone tomorrow
Criminal law changes all the time. Certain things that are legal today will be illegal tomorrow, and everything you say (and many places you go and things you do) are [recorded and shared with law enforcement already](TODO://NSA-SHARING-WITH-CIA). In the US today you couldn't necessarily be legally prosecuted for these crimes, but assuming any law is going to be timeless seems risky. Once it's recorded, [it doesn't have to go away](StorageIsTheStart). Ever.

More important than legitimate criminal activity is earning yourself a label as someone that would be considered dangerous or undesirable to the state*. Several countries, for example, have recently made it illegal to be a "practicing" homosexual, and history is littered with other examples of similar judgements against Jews, Muslims, Christians, blacks, and other groups that are guilty of no actual crimes. Handing the government a database with every one of its citizens and labels on these sorts of facts could easily, given the right motivations, turn into a straightforward mechanism for arresting or otherwise sabotaging their targets.

#### Others do need protection
Some of the greatest human rights revolutions have happened on the backs of large movememts driven by a few pivotal characters.
