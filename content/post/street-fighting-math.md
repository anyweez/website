It's pretty rare to see an entire field redefined before you, especially when you're relatively young. Education, I think, is both a tremendously important practice, both culturally and socially, and is nearing on it's way up a climb that will shatter what exists today with obsolescence. The very objective of education has 
recently changed, and many of the things we're doing today still drive towards yesterday's goal, not the one our new ship is sailing towards.

Education is, in my opinion, the most interesting challenge of our day, and innovation is beginning to flex it's boundaries. There's no question that it's critically important that we keep the goals of education in-line with the goals of society as innovation and change accelerates faster than ever before.

Let's consider a few facts relevant today to better understand the challenge before us.

* Many students spend their most influential years in school, yet today we administer education like medicine; something they don't want to take but have to because it's good for them. I am convinced, and will elaborate further in future posts, that this is both unnecessary and suboptimal for students as well as teachers; motivation in particular is grossly underemphasized as an outcome in today's system. 

* Modern education systems are _very_ slow to adapt, unlike 21st century industry. We are currently training people for jobs that won't exist by the time they graduate. Changes that are made _today_ will still take eighteen years to generate the first class of students that have fully passed through the new version of the system. Google didn't exist when I was in elementary school. We need to predict the future, or at least teach things that are resistant to social evolution.

* Teaching has to be unblocked. Educators are vastly undervalued and their careers overly constrained, and current conditions require extreme dedication to keep impactful teachers in the classroom. Relatively low salaries are part of the problem, but a much larger problem is the tidal wave of bureacracy and regulation that chokes our academic institutions (and the lack of an effective insulator between regulation and teachers).

First, let's disambiguate between two concepts that are often merged: education and school. The primary method of education that we recognize today is schooling, and many think of them as one in the same. Education is the goal, and school is one mechanism for achieving that goal. Historically schools have been a relatively cost-effective way to communicate large amounts of information to students, and have made it possible to maximize the reach of subject matter experts (teachers) on those  enrolled. 

What's interesting is that historically one of the biggest motivating factors for schools is that sources of knowledge (teachers) were expensive and limited by the number of students they could teach. As cash-strapped programs pushed their limits, the task of educating the many became even more challenging, pulled even further from their effective limits by a cascade of rules and regulations striving to make schools better at educating. What many decision-makers don't realize is that it isn't the quantity or quality of what it is we're doing that's the core problem. The core  problem is that *what we're trying to do* isn't right any more.

### The problem has changed
Yesterday information discovery was a non-trivial task. It required finding someone who had the information that you wanted or poking around in a library for a 
useful book. Today, the power of internet and search has changed this entirely. Access to information is free, fast, and (almost) universally available. Even if you need more than text, videos are abundant and email makes it possible to communicate with anyone anywhere at any time. All that's required to learn something is enough motivation to do so.

Conversely, because information is so readily available it's also possible to learn almost anything that one could want. The challenge for a modern education system isn't to communicate more information; it is to motivate the topics that a student should understand to be an effective citizen. Convincing a student to dedicate time to a topic given the abundance of other things they could be doing with their time is both a formitable challenge and a noble goal.

Let's consider a few golden nuggets to help paint the picture a bit more clearly:

**Target: inspiration.** Today's school systems are optimized for information transmission. Homework, lectures, and exams to test comprehension are the related fundamental [measurement mechanisms](/post/problem-with-measurement) of most schools. Certain _teachers_ are very good at motivating, but it is the excellence of the individual, not the merits of the system, that often brings that out. Some schools are also very good at this, but these are rarer and generally alternative programs that deviate from today's norms.

**Contextualization.** Many of today's subjects are taught in the abstract: Algebra I, Chemistry, History, and so on. I've got much more to say on this topic of context in the future, but as taught today these are foreign from the everyday experience of most students. Very few students emerge from twelve years of school with a keen interest in biology, history, computer science, trigonometry, AND public speaking, not to mention a single one of them. [Street-fighting math](/post/street-fighting-math), however, though not directly relevant, at least contextualizes the content into something that is interesting, and is among a growing set of classes that try to make the subject 
matter appeal to students from the moment they read the course description.

**Information avaiability.** The internet as it exists today is still in it's early days. A huge amount of information is already available at our fingertips, and the potential for future innovations that make it even more feasible to learn from anywhere are only going to broaden the gap between where we want to be and where we're heading. Changing an education system takes time, and feeling the effects of the change can take decades.

So what is it that we need? In short, we need a way to convince students, especially young ones, that learning X is worthwhile. Maybe this is in a classroom and maybe it's not. Maybe it's with a textbook and maybe it's not. The solutions are out there, and they're stable enough to keep us moving forward for a long, long time.
