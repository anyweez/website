I’ve been doing a lot of reflection recently on what I find important. A good friend just sent me [Sam Altman’s latest write-up](http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short) on life advice now that he’s hit the ripe old age of 30 and I thought the exercise (as well as his version of the output) was really interesting. Several of my mentors have encouraged me to periodically reflect deeply on where I’ve come and where I want to go, and I’ve been tossing around a couple of nuggets for several months now, though I’ve never taken the time to polish them.

I spent a few hours recently applying some polish to my own response and came up with a couple of key ideas that seem to positively affect my happiness more than ever. Though some of them have origins in work relationships, I’ve found them all to be tremendously useful when applied to life more broadly.

__Be ambitious and intentional.__

* I'm had to fight my nature but have found a lot of joy in doing things that aren't productive (at least, traditionally defined as such). Just walking around and noticing stuff, for example, feels like a great way to spend time. A few years ago that was absolutely not true and I much prefer where I am today.

* Avoid rapid context switching. Decide what you're doing all the time and do it. Don't try to juggle five things together because it takes away from the experience of each of them. Don't just do something because it’s available; be intentional, regardless of what the specific intention is.

* Always keep learning. It doesn't have to be a skill that's going to help you at work, but it should be something that makes you better on dimensions that you care about (i.e. technical prowess, patience, creativity, getting along with other people, etc).

* Don’t try to do everything, but don’t sell yourself short. Pick your battles. Be aware of what’s important to you and fight like hell to make it happen.


__Love people and let them know it.__

* Sam nailed this one in his post. People have complicated stories and very few are legitimately terrible. Pay attention to people and assume good intentions. Don't underestimate the power of kindness.

* You literally can't tell people that you appreciate them enough. It's amazing how much it can mean to hear it, and you never know when you might lose the chance to say it. Don't wait.

* Don't let yourself overreact. Abraham Lincoln used to put any heated letter that he wrote in a cabinet overnight, then reread it in the morning before sending it. Nothing is gained from overreacting, and the key to avoiding it is knowing to watch for it.

__Don't sweat the small stuff (and it's all small stuff).__

* Silly things feel very stressful in the moment. Think big picture and try to keep things from blowing out of proportion.

* Stress is toxic. Avoid it when you can, especially when you're not benefiting from it.

__No regrets.__

* Like Sam said, if you think you're going to regret it, do it. Second chances are rare.

* Avoid setting yourself up for regret. Always be striking things off and adding things on to your bucket list. Though it might sound morbid, be ready to die at any time.

* Confront fear.

And last but not least, an excellent quote that I think pulls all of this together:

> "I shall pass this way but once; any good that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being; let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."
- Etienne de Grellet

Live, love, learn.
