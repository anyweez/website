I love nonfiction. I finished reading [Guns, Germs, and Steel](http://tbd) recently (another book I may write about later!) which describes writing as one of the underappreciated technologies that gave Europeans an advantage in their conquest of ancient American cultures like the Aztecs and Incas. The key advantage in that case is how much it's possible to learn from reading the work of others. Though I think it's certainly true of fiction as well, I regularly come across non-fiction books that change the way I think about something by the time I'm done, and with all of the travel time I have these days I get to spend a lot of time reading.

Below I've included a list of some books that have changed the way that I thought about something; they cover a variety of topics that I find interesting. Pretty much all of them are for "beginners" on a given topic, so relatively little background is required. I'll likely follow up with more of these in the future as I discover more nuggets.

[**Man's Search for Meaning**](http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X) by Viktor Frankl is a book written by a Jewish psychiatrist who was sent to Auschwitz during WWII and emerged from the camps with a new perspective on what drives individuals to continue to fight during the darkest of times. He's got the unique perspective of someone who spent years in a series of the most infamous concentration camps as well as someone with a sophisticated understanding of human thought processes and puts both of them to good use in his book. Though I've never been through anything remotely as horrifying as concetration camp life, I find the lessons his extracts from his time there to match my own experience and philosophy quite well: that humans are motivated by the search for meaning, and that finding a sense of meaning one way or another gives us extraordinary willingness to fight for making it a reality.

As a relative newcomer to psychiatry, I found the first part of his book, which focused on his time in the concentration camp, to be the most approachable and useful section. The second half, dedicated to distilling his philosophy ("[logotherapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy)"), was informative but the gist was unsurprising after his narration of the events in the first section. The first section was the type of thing that I think honestly could be appreciated by most people and provides valuable insight into a remarkable case study of perseverence in a time where very few things are going your way.

[**A Universe from Nothing**](http://www.amazon.com/Universe-Nothing-There-Something-Rather/dp/1451624468) by Lawrence Krauss is one of the most exciting books I've read in a while. For someone with a healthy dose of excitement for outer space (and perhaps a little bit of background), this book is incredibly engaging and proceeds through a remarkable amount of content in a logical and easy-to-follow way. It covers a lot of ground discussing what we believe to be true about our universe, how compelling the evidence is (as well as the evolution of that evidence), and some of the important questions that we can't yet answer. The science is also pretty up to date, covering the discovery of the Higgs boson a couple of years ago with some background on why that's important.

I came out feeling not only like I'd learned a lot but that I actually understood it well enough to explain it to someone else. I wrapped this book up a month or so and have been on an intense space kick ever since. If you're at all interested in the origin of the universe, how things have proceeded since the Big Bang, or what's likely to happen down the road a couple of billion years, there aren't many books I'd endorse more than this one.

[**Twlight of the Elites**](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Elites-America-After-Meritocracy/dp/0307720462) by Christopher Hayes discusses some of the forces that have led to the crystalization of the ruling American elite and the impact that it has on everyone else, especially those born in the last two or three decades. The book outlines a series of major leadership catastrophes that have occurred during the past twenty years or so, including the [MLB steroid scandal](http://tbd), [the Catholic church scandal](http://tbd), the [Iraq War](http://tbd), [Enron](http://tbd), and the [housing bubble](http://tbd), and making the point that Americans around my age (late 20's) are born into an environment encouraging a distrust for bureacracy across government, business, religion, entertainment, and other important pillars of society. I personally feel a lot of effects of the trends that the book calls out and put a lot of value into decentralization and checks and balances.

[**Flatland**](http://www.amazon.com/Flatland-Illustrated-Edwin-Abbott/dp/1623750318) by Edwin Abbott wins the award for the most minds blown per page. It's a tiny little book written by a teacher and religious leader a while back that explores the complex concept of dimensionality from the perspective of a sphere, who is the protagonist. The sphere (a three dimensional figure) visits two-dimension spaces populated by circles, squares, and other two dimension figures, and can defy imagination by moving around in the third dimension, effectively changing its size and even disappearing from view entirely. The two dimensional shapes then visit a one-dimensional space (a line with dots scooting around on it) and accomplish similar feats there.

I'm thankful for this book because it gave me the framework to think about things involving more than the four dimensions (3D space + time) that we regularly experience without a bunch of theory-speak. It's an incredibly simple book in terms of plot, is quick to read and relatively easy to follow, but still stretches your brain in fun ways.

[**Conversations with God**](http://www.amazon.com/Flatland-Illustrated-Edwin-Abbott/dp/1623750318) by Neale Donald Walsh is a new age book that opened my eyes to the wide world of religious diversity many years ago. The narrative plot of the book (that the author is communicating directly with a God-like figure, though not in the traditional western sense) is a bit of an intellectual stretch but also irrelevant to the true content of the book. The book asks interesting questions from the perspective of God about why we humans expect things to be one way or the other, and focuses as much on these questions as it does on any particular answers. It also has some practical lessons about life, one of my favorite ones being that "the opposite of love is fear," not hatred, which still sticks with me to this day. Without trying to be overly scientific or preachy I found that the questions that the book asks explictly have led to some of the most important religious and spiritual iterations I've ever been through.

[**The Second Machine Age**](http://www.amazon.com/Flatland-Illustrated-Edwin-Abbott/dp/1623750318) by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee is all about the future of work, another topic that I find fascinating. In my opinion the authors hedge their bets on this one a bit too much after making some really compelling points about why computing isn't just another cotton gin. One of their central theses relates the digital revolution to the industrial revolution in an incredibly important way: _the industrial revolution was the period where machines surpassed humans for tasks involving physical work, and the computing revolution is where machines will surpass humans for tasks involving mental work._ Few people claims that all mental jobs are on the way out immediately, similar to how many jobs requiring physical strength or skills still exist, but considering the potential of computing to continue to grow towards and beyond the capabilities of the human brain has monumental implications for the human position in a productive society. 

A lot of the ideas of this book can be found by reading related articles online but this is a really good place to learn the middle of the road argument for why significant changes are coming and what that's going to mean for all of us.
