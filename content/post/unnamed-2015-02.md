### Why computing is important
Understanding computing isn't only knowing how to write an app or a website. It's not knowing
how to fix your friend's computer, get your mom's email working again, or format a Word document. 
It's being excited about and willing to think about one of the greatest information revolutions 
the world has ever seen and how to leverage the power of computers and networks to solve problems 
that have existed since the beginning of human history. Yes, it involves algorithms, math, 
"understanding computers," and learning to code, but that's not what we do. That's how we do it.

What we do is more important than how we do it. Consider the pen. It's forebearers gave us access to two of the most important skills
that humans have ever come up with: reading and writing. These two skills allow us to
record and share knowledge with others when we aren't there. Information began to
exist outside of its human host and could be shared in times and places when no
one who understood it was around. Given that knowledge builds upon itself, this has
been instrumental in allowing us to move forward as a society and solve our problems.
It has also been a key enabler of centuries of entertainment and cultural development.  

Interestingly, despite the importance of reading and writing, very little progress has been
made with how we do these things. We've come up with longer-lasting paper, inks of various 
colors, and a few other important innovations, but none have dramatically changed the way
that we read and write, despite the fact that some fairly obvious weaknesses exist:

1) Permenance. Paper doesn't last forever, and old knowledge can be lost when the paper or ink fades.
In a sense, stone-etched tablets like the Rosetta Stone were available for recording long-lived data
but writing on stone was a slow and laborious process.

2) Distribution. Writing something on a sheet of paper meant that there were basically two copies of a piece of
information; it was still necessary for someone to have access to one of those copies (either the person 
or their writing) in order to learn from it. Books or other writings still have to be distributed to the
people who want to learn before they can benefit, and if multiple people want to use the same resources
at the same time then more copies need to be made. Transportation has made this easier and faster but not

3) Language dependence. Human civilization has yet to converge on a single written language for
communicating information, so an individual can't benefit from written knowledge unless they're
able to read it. The field of mathematics has worked hard to converge upon a single syntax for
describing concepts within their field, but it appears to be far more complex to come up with a
single language that works for general information.

4) Information deluge. Over the course of history we've managed to write down a lot of stuff, and
finding information (either stuff that's been explicitly written down or patterns in all of the data
that we haven't noticed yet) is really hard. In some ways, we suffer from having so much information
that finding what we need is sometimes the hardest part of solving a problem.

Computing may be the first major revolution we've had to how we read and write information
in the history of humanity. Today's computers and computer networks give us dramatically
improved solutions to all of the problems mentioned above, which is toppling entire areas of business,
solving long-standing problems, and forcing us to rethink laws that assumed that the milennia-old
assumptions mentioned above would always be true. Never before have we been able to help people
dig through literally trillions of books, documents, images, music, videos, and other content, copy that knowledge
an infinite number of times, translate it into any language*, and transport it across the world to anyone 
who wants it, all for free and in a fraction of a second. The internet lets us do this every day. Everything 
about that would have been indistinguishable from magic for anyone before the dawn of computing. 

Broadly speaking, many problems are caused or left unsolved because of a lack of information. Farmers
in developing markets take food to sell despite the fact that no one's there to buy it. Military generals
make wartime decisions based on partial or out-of-date information. You buy a car from an overpriced dealership
because you didn't know a friend around the corner was trying to sell the same car for less. Minority opinions
aren't published in leading media channels because the companies are too concerned with repercussions. Individuals
are kept from speaking by oppressive governments. Universities and employers turn down great candidates in favor
of goods ones because the good candidate had better tests scores or interviews. An aspiring student can't learn
how to do something because no one in their community knows how to do it. A doctor can't diagnose a rare
illness because they've never seen it in person before. A community isn't able to evacuate before a natural disaster 
because they didn't know it was coming. Crops go dry because a village can't find and access the underground water 
source nearby. There are no shortage of problems that affect any segment of the world's population that are 
fundamentally information problems.

### Thinking with technology
Computing is a big deal, and it shakes foundational components of our society that have been in
place for hundreds of years. At a higher level, people involved in technology are thinking about
how to solve issues not only within the field of technology but how to improve efficiency and effectiveness
in almost every other field of human interest. At a lower level, we're converting tasks that used to 
be manual or simply infeasible to automatic with the assistance of computer programs that are able to 
work thousands of times faster than humans with flawless precision, often at lower cost.

We program computers to teach them how to do these things, and the act of programming is often
highly creative, mentally stimulating work. It involves giving a computer a clearly defined
process that you want to accomplish, as well as access to inputs (things to read) and requests for 
outputs (things to write). Once a program is written it can be run any number of times to achieve the
same effect; for example, after designing a program that predicts the path of a hurricane, the same
program can be run season after season to reap the benefits of the initial work. The pervasiveness of 
reading and writing with pens indicates how important recorded information is across the spectrum of 
human activity, and the potential reach of the impact of computer technology.

### So what.
The field of computing is in the very early days and is already affecting your life in ways that 
you don't yet realize; much, much more is still to come. It is one of the greatest efficiency boosters 
we've discovered in centuries, with extremely high potential to make things better than they are, and 
the only thing limiting its impact is the number of minds that are willing to make innovation real. 
Maybe that does mean learning how to code or how to make a website, but above all it means having a 
desire to solve problems that affect us, even if those who came before us thought those problems were unsolveable. 

Learning a little can go a long way. Start learning and thinking now.

* We've still got some work to do here but we've made tremendous progress recently and the problem appears
to be far more solvable than it once did.
