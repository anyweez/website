The Republic national debates are in full swing now and I'm starting to start to think critically about what I want the next ten years to look like for our country. I've been thinking about taxation recently, and I'm curious what sort of taxation system we should be shooting for here; we seem to want a functioning government, which requires some sort of funding, but the [current arrangement is a mess](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/15/charted-the-skyrocketing-complexity-of-the-federal-tax-code/) to say the least.

One problem in today's political discussion is that "tax" is a bad word unless it's immediately preceded with "cut." We certainly have some taxes that need to be cut, or at least simplified, but government services (including funding wars, healthcare, and highways) don't come for free, and [people aren't particularly good at managing shared resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) like the environment. **If we were to wipe out the entire American tax code today, what would we want to replace it with?** It's easy to get stuck in the rat's nest of policy that's already out there, but do we know where we're trying to get when it comes to taxation?

Personally I want our federal government to have a budget, and therefore I think it's important to tax its citizens in reasonable ways. I think both our government and it's citizens will be best served by taxes that align the incentives for all of those involved, meaning that they encourage individuals, companies, and the government to "do the right thing" from each others' perspectives. One form of tax that I'm increasingly favorable to for this reason are referred to as [Pigovian taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax), and they're applied to activities or goods that generate negative externalities. Some common examples would be taxing unhealthy foods, destructive environmental practices, or gasoline.

  - Taxing these services decreases consumption. When things cost more, people buy less (the size of the effect depends on price elasticity).
  - The revenue generated from taxation can be used to mitigate the externalities. Smoking, for example, is a [tremendous burden on healthcare](http://www.cancer.org/research/infographicgallery/tobacco-related-healthcare-costs). A tax on tobacco products could be reinvested in healthcare and lung cancer research. 

That last one is one of the most powerful features of Pigovian taxes: funds raised by the taxes can be fed back into programs that help offset the externalities that they generate. For example, gas taxes can be used to support research for more fuel-efficient vehicles. When more of the harmful services are being used, more money is available for offsetting the harm; when fewer services are being used, less money is available.

It'd be interesting to find examples of where Pigovian taxes are applied to specific services (i.e. soft drinks, gasoline, cigarettes) and that money then reinvested specifically into programs that combat the externalities.

## Incentive slippage
One important distinction with Pigovian taxes is that they lead to "social optimums" under certain circumstances[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax#Working_of_the_Pigovian_tax), but incentives can fall out of line if you use the generated funds for other government services not related to the service or good being taxed. For example, if we spend revenue generated from gas taxes on paying for schools, then the government falls into a position where it either needs to keep people buying gas or it's ability to fund schools will be affected. This suggests that you shouldn't use Pigovian taxes as foundational taxes to provide general-purpose funding, but they can provide a balanced mechanism for countering the social costs of many goods.

My takeaway from all of this is that Pigovian taxes are a great tool for countering some of today's important issues, but won't serve as an effective long-lasting replacement for other tools like income and sales taxes. We could likely make pretty major strides on both general and specialized healthcare, energy independence, and environmental sustainability if we were willing to put Pigovian taxes and corresponding relief programs to work more frequently.
