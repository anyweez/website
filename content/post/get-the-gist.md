Learning new stuff can be really intimidating, especially if it's in a field you don't know much about. Many topics are big and meaty so figuring out where to start can sometimes be the hardest part of getting going, especially if you don't have access to someone who knows the ropes and can help you break it down. As a firm believer in the [protégé effect](http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/), I'm going to try kicking off a series of posts that I'm calling "gists" that have two interrelated goals:

1. Force myself to understand difficult concepts well enough to explain them to someone with no background on the topic. This is an exciting motivation for me to learn interesting and challenging new things.
2. Give readers enough information to start asking questions of their own, effectively bootstrapping the problem described above.

One of the things I'm most excited about with this idea is the fact that the pool of topics is infinite, and I'm far from an expert on almost all of them.  I do want to constrain myself some to make sure I don't end up all over the place and focus on the type of topics best suited for the goals above. The framework I'm currently thinking through is composed of the following rules:

- I want to focus on fact- or theory-based topics. Topics that are highly opinionated (political, religious, etc) are generally out of bounds.
- I want to be concise. There's no way I'll be able to cover a full topic at a detailed level and still communicate the important high-level points that I want to. This means that I'll be intentionally leaving out a lot of detail, many of them important for "understanding" a topic.
- I want to cover a variety of topics, including some outside of my current areas of expertise. That makes it more fun for me and hopefully inspires others to generate some gists in their own areas of expertise that can supercede mine ;-)
- I want to expose but not depend on jargon from the field to the extent that I can do so clearly. Jargon can often be a great jumping-off point in itself so I feel like there's value in presenting it, even if it does run the risk of making the content itself more cryptic.

My goal for each gist is that an average reader would be able to walk away with enough of an intuitive understanding (and hopefully curiousity!) of the topic to ask follow-up questions and learn more elsewhere. Some of my current ideas are (in no particular order):

- Common Core curriculum: what it is, what it's trying to do, and how it's trying to do it
- Computer viruses: what they are and a bit o' history
- The stock market: to the extent that any mortal can attempt to explain it
- Global warming
- Spacetime and time dilation
- Quantum theory
- The Internet
- Design of experiments: what scientific experiments are designed to do and some of the standard designs
- Net neutrality

Easy, right?
